[Beyond modelling and prediction, data might have many more stories to tell. Exploring data to uncover patterns and structures, involves both numerical and visual techniques designed to reveal interesting information that may be unexpected. However, an analyst must be cautious not to over-interpret apparent patterns, and to use randomisation tools to assess whether the patterns are real or spurious.]{.monash-blue}

1. learn to use modern data exploration tools with many different types of contemporary data to uncover interesting structures, unusual relationships and anomalies.
2. understand how to map out appropriate analyses for a given data set and description, define what we would expect to see in the data, and whether what we see is contrary to expectations.
3. be able to compute null samples in order to test apparent patterns, and to interpret the results using computational methods for statistical inference. 
4. critically assess the strength and adequacy of data analysis.

## Why exploratory data analysis? {.transition-slide .center}

<br><br>
What's special about exploring data, in contrast to confirmatory data analysis?

::: {.fragment}
Let's look at some common definitions and quotes of "exploratory data analysis".

> In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

## A simple example to illustrate "exploratory data analysis" contrasted with a "confirmatory data analysis"  {.transition-slide .center}

## What are the factors that affect tipping behaviour? {background-image="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WO7SYkeQL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" background-size="18%" background-position="15% 90%"}

::: {.column width=50% style="font-size: 70%;"}

In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990.

Food servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers.

## What is tipping?

- When you're dining at a full-service restaurant
    - Tip 20 percent of your full bill.
- When you grab a cup of coffee
    - Round up or add a dollar if you’re a regular or ordered a complicated drink.
- When you have lunch at a food truck
    - Drop a few dollars into the tip jar, but a little less than you would at a dine-in spot.
- When you use a gift card
    - Tip on the total value of the meal, not just what you paid out of pocket.

<br><br>

[The basic rules of tipping that everyone should know about](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/going-out-guide/wp/2016/09/15/tipping-can-be-complicated-these-are-the-basic-rules-you-should-know-about/)
:::

## Recommended procedure in the book

- *Step 1*: Develop a model
    - Should the response be `tip` alone and use the total bill as a predictor?
    - Should you create a new variable `tip rate` and use this as the repsonse?
- *Step 2*: Fit the full model with sex, smoker, day, time and size as predictors
- *Step 3*: Refine model: Should some variables should be dropped?
- *Step 4*: Check distribution of residuals
- *Step 5*: Summarise the model, if X=something, what would be the expected tip


## Step 1

Calculate tip % as tip/total bill $\times$ 100

<br>
<br>
<br>



```{r echo = TRUE}
tips <- tips %>%
  mutate(tip_pct = tip/totbill * 100) 
```

<br><br>

::: { style="font-size: 70%;"}
**Note**: Creating new variables (sometimes called feature engineering), is a common step in any data analysis.
:::


## Step 2 Fit

Fit the full model with all variables

<br>
<br>

```{r echo = TRUE}
tips_lm <- tips %>%
  select(tip_pct, sex, smoker, day, time, size) %>%
  lm(tip_pct ~ ., data=.) 
```


## Step 2 Model summary

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

```{r modela, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
library(broom)
library(kableExtra)
tidy(tips_lm) %>% 
  kable(digits=2) %>% 
  kable_styling() 
```

```{r modelb, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
glance(tips_lm) %>% 
  select(r.squared, statistic, 
         p.value) %>% 
  kable(digits=3)
```

:::

::: {.column style="font-size: 70%;"}


```{r ref.label="modela", echo=FALSE}
```
<br>
```{r ref.label="modelb", echo=FALSE}
```


🤔 Which variable(s) would be considered important for predicting tip %?

:::
::::

## Step 3: Refine model

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

```{r model_smalla, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
tips_lm <- tips %>%
  select(tip_pct, size) %>% 
  lm(tip_pct ~ ., data=.) 
tidy(tips_lm) %>% 
  kable(digits=2) %>% 
  kable_styling() 
```

```{r model_smallb, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
glance(tips_lm) %>% 
  select(r.squared, statistic, p.value) %>% 
  kable(digits=3)
```

:::
::: {.column style="font-size: 70%;"}
<br>
```{r ref.label="model_smalla", echo=FALSE}
```
<br>
```{r ref.label="model_smallb", echo=FALSE}
```

:::
::::


## Model summary

<br>
<br>

$$\widehat{tip %} = 18.44 - 0.92 \times size$$

::: {.fragment}

<br>
<br>

As the size of the dining party increases by one person the tip decreases by approximately 1%.
:::


## Model assessment

<br>
<br>
<br>
$R^2 = 0.02$.

::: {.fragment}

<br>
<br>
This dropped by half from the full model, even though no other variables contributed significantly to the model. It might be a good step to examine interaction terms. 


What does $R^2 = 0.02$ mean?
:::

## Model assessment

$R^2 = 0.02$ means that size explains just 2% of the variance in tip %. This is a [very weak model]{.monash-blue2}. 

::: {.fragment}

And $R^2 = 0.04$ is [also a very weak model]{.monash-blue2}.

What do the $F$ statistic and $p$-value mean?

What do the $t$ statistics and $p$-value associated with model coefficients mean?

:::

## Overall model significance

Assume that we have a random sample from a population. Assume that the model for the population is 

$$ \widehat{tip %} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 sexM + ... + \beta_7 size $$
and we have observed

$$ \widehat{tip %} = b_0 + b_1  sexM + ... + b_7 size $$
The $F$ statistic refers to 

$$ H_o: \beta_1 = ... = \beta_7 = 0 ~~ vs ~~ H_a: \text{at least one is not 0}$$
The $p$-value is the probability that we observe the given $F$ value or larger, computed assuming $H_o$ is true.


## Term significance

Assume that we have a random sample from a population. Assume that the model for the population is 

$$ \widehat{tip %} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 sexM + ... + \beta_7 size $$
and we have observed

$$ \widehat{tip %} = b_0 + b_1  sexM + ... + b_7 size $$

The $t$ statistics in the coefficient summary refer to 

$$ H_o: \beta_k = 0 ~~ vs ~~ H_a: \beta_k \neq 0 $$
The $p$-value is the probability that we observe the given $t$ value or more extreme, computed assuming $H_o$ is true.


## Model diagnostics (MD)

Normally, the final model summary would be accompanied diagnostic plots

- [observed vs fitted values]{.monash-blue2} to check strength and appropriateness of the fit
- [univariate plot, and normal probability plot, of residuals]{.monash-blue2} to check for normality
- in the simple final model like this, the [observed vs predictor]{.monash-blue2}, with model overlaid would be advised to assess the model relative to the variability around the model
- when the final model has more terms, using a [partial dependence plot]{.monash-blue2} to check the relative relationship between the response and predictors would be recommended.

Its a good idea to examine the data description, the explanation of the variables, and how the data was collected. 

- You need to know what [type of variables]{.monash-blue2} are in the data in order to decide appropriate choice of plots, and calculations to make. 
- Data description should have information about [data collection methods]{.monash-blue2}, so that the extent of what we learn from the data might apply to new data.

- Most tips less than 20%: Skin flints vs generous diners
- A couple of big tips
- Banding horizontally is the rounding seen previously

## Relative to categorical variables

```{r tips_sexsmoke, echo=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
p + facet_grid(smoker~sex) #<<

- The bigger bills tend to be paid by men (and females that smoke).
- Except for three diners, female non-smokers are very consistent tippers, probably around 15-18% though.
- The variability in the smokers is much higher than for the non-smokers.

## Procedure of EDA

- We gained a wealth of insight in a short time. 
- Using nothing but graphical methods we investigated univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships. 
- We found both global features and local detail. We saw that 
    - tips were rounded; then we saw the obvious  
    - correlation between the tip and the size of the bill, noting the scarcity of generous tippers; finally we 
    - discovered differences in the tipping behavior of male and female smokers and non-smokers.

[These are unexpected insights]{.monash-orange2} were missed from the analysis that focused solely on the primary question.

## What can go wrong? {.transition-slide .center  style="text-align: center;"}

## How was data collected?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
*In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all customers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990.*
:::
::: {.column}
How much can you [infer about tipping more broadly]{.monash-blue2}?

::: {.fragment}
- Tip has a weak but significant relationship with total bill?
- Tips have a skewed distribution? (More small tips and fewer large tips?)
- Tips tend to be made in nice round numbers.
- People generally under-tip?
- Smokers are less reliable tippers.

## Ways to verify, support or refute generalisations

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- external information
- other studies/samples
- good choice of calculations and plots
- all the permutations and subsets of measured variables
- computational re-sampling methods (we'll see these soon)

::: {.column}

::: {.info}
Poor data collection methods affects every analysis, including statistical or computational modeling.

For this waiter and the restaurant manager, there is some useful information. Like what? 

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 70%;"}
- Service fee for smokers to ensure consistency?
- Assign waiter to variety of party sizes and composition.
- Shifts on different days or time of day (not shown).

## Words of wisdom {.transition-slide .center}

*False discovery* is the lesser danger when compared to non-discovery. **Non-discovery** is the failure to identify meaningful structure, and it may result in false or incomplete modeling. In a healthy scientific enterprise, the **fear of non-discovery** should be at least as great as the *fear of false discovery*.

## Where do we go from here?

- Methods for single, bivariate, multivariate
    - numerical variables
    - categorical variables
- Methods to accommodate temporal and spatial context
- How to make effective comparisons
- Utilising computational methods to assess what you see is "real"
