    "text": "Welcome!\n\n\nSynopsis\nBeyond modelling and prediction, data might have many more stories to tell. Exploring data to uncover patterns and structures, involves both numerical and visual techniques designed to reveal interesting information that may be unexpected. However, an analyst must be cautious not to over-interpret apparent patterns, and to use randomisation tools to assess whether the patterns are real or spurious.\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\n\nlearn to use modern data exploration tools with many different types of contemporary data to uncover interesting structures, unusual relationships and anomalies.\nunderstand how to map out appropriate analyses for a given data set and description, define what we would expect to see in the data, and whether what we see is contrary to expectations.\nbe able to compute null samples in order to test apparent patterns, and to interpret the results using computational methods for statistical inference.\ncritically assess the strength and adequacy of data analysis."

    "text": "🧩 Tasks\n\n1. What are the variable types, how and when was the data collected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is collected in 2020 and 2021, and has a variety of numeric and categorical and time variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. What would some possible questions be to ask about this data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe link to the ChatGPT conversation is here. It was prompted by\n\nDo you know the gardenR package by Lisa Lendway?\nWhat might be some questions that we could answer with this data?\n\nWe chose to tackle one of the Economics questions: “How much produce (by weight or value) was harvested per dollar spent?” But realised that it was not possible answer this particular question with this data. It was refined to be:\nCompare the ROI for varieties of beans.\nThe next step was to filter the data to focus on one vegetable, beans, and one year to get started.\n\n\nCode\nbeans_planting_2020 &lt;- planting_2020 |&gt;\n  filter(vegetable == \"beans\")\nbeans_harvest_2020 &lt;- harvest_2020 |&gt;\n  filter(vegetable == \"beans\")\nbeans_spending_2020 &lt;- spending_2020 |&gt;\n  filter(vegetable == \"beans\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. What do you expect to find?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might expect some difference in ROI between varieties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Pick one of the questions, and let’s try to answer it.\n\nWhat summaries should we make?\nAre we likely going to need to pre-process the data in any way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to decide on a common scale. Steps are:\n\nexamine the price for each variety\nsummarise the planting data by variety and join to spending data.\nsummarise the harvest data by variety and join to spending.\n\n\n\nCode\nbeans_spending_2020 |&gt;\n  select(variety, brand, price_with_tax)\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  variety             brand          price_with_tax\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bush Bush Slender   Renee's Garden           3.01\n2 Chinese Red Noodle  Baker Creek              3.24\n3 Classic Slenderette Renee's Garden           3.23\n\n\nCode\nbeans_planting_2020_smry &lt;- beans_planting_2020 |&gt;\n  group_by(variety) |&gt;\n  summarise(number_seeds_planted = sum(number_seeds_planted))\n\nbeans_2020_smry &lt;- beans_spending_2020 |&gt;\n  select(variety, brand, price_with_tax) |&gt;\n  left_join(beans_planting_2020_smry)\n\nggplot(beans_2020_smry, \n       aes(price_with_tax, \n           number_seeds_planted)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbeans_2020_smry |&gt; \n  mutate(pr_per_seed = price_with_tax/number_seeds_planted) |&gt;\n  select(variety, pr_per_seed)\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  variety             pr_per_seed\n  &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bush Bush Slender        0.0752\n2 Chinese Red Noodle       0.324 \n3 Classic Slenderette      0.111 \n\n\nCode\n# Do all the seed packs have the same number of seeds, \n# or did Lisa plant every seed in every pack?\n\n# Harvest\nbeans_harvest_2020_smry &lt;- beans_harvest_2020 |&gt;\n  group_by(variety) |&gt;\n  summarise(weight = sum(weight))\nbeans_harvest_2020_smry\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  variety             weight\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bush Bush Slender    10038\n2 Chinese Red Noodle     356\n3 Classic Slenderette   1635\n\n\nCode\nbeans_2020_smry &lt;- beans_2020_smry |&gt;\n  left_join(beans_harvest_2020_smry)\n\nbeans_2020_smry &lt;- beans_2020_smry |&gt;\n  mutate(psy = weight/number_seeds_planted)\nbeans_2020_smry\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  variety             brand     price_with_tax number_seeds_planted weight   psy\n  &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bush Bush Slender   Renee's …           3.01                   40  10038 251. \n2 Chinese Red Noodle  Baker Cr…           3.24                   10    356  35.6\n3 Classic Slenderette Renee's …           3.23                   29   1635  56.4\n\n\nProblems encountered.\n\nSpending didn’t specify what the cost involved, whether it was one packet of seeds,\nNot clear whether all seeds in each packet were planted. Numbers suggest, no, because some varieties had many sends and others very few.\n\nAdjustments:\n\nweight was adjusted by number of seeds planted\n\nConclusion:\nBush Bush Slender outperforms the other two, by a lot! This should also indicate that this variety is a better ROI.\nCaveats: Need to check that\n\nthe plots where each was planted was a reasonable chance that they had same access to sunlight and nutrients.\nAssuming that seeds were planted at same distance from each other.\n\n\nNext steps\nExamine the 2021 data. If same varieties grown do the same results happen.\nProblems discovered in doing this: Name of variety in 2021 might have changed to be just “Bush”, and the other two were not used. Could compare against the one new variety."
