Then assuming that the person cannot distinguish flavours and order of tasting the skittles does not matter, \\(X \\sim B(10, 0.2)\\). Then \\(P(X = 2) = {10 \\choose 2} 0.2^2 0.8^8\\approx 0.3\\).

Suppose each tasting is independent and has a equal probability of identifying the flavour correctly; we denote this probability as \\(p\\). We test the hypotheses: \\(H_0: p = 0.2\\) vs. \\(H_1: p &gt; 0.2\\). Under \\(H_0\\), \\(X\\sim B(30, 0.2)\\) and therefore the \\(p\\)-value is \\(P(X \\geq 15) \\approx 0.0002\\). The \\(p\\)-value is small so the data supports that people can correctly identify the flavour of a skittle!\n\nsum(skittle$correct)\n\n[1] 15\n\n1 - pbinom(sum(skittle$correct), 30, 0.2)\n\n[1] 5.2e-05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn part (d) we disregarded the order of the tasting and the possible variability in people’s ability to correctly identify the flavour. If in fact these do matter, then how would you construct the test statistic? Is it easy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo construct a test statistic, we need to construct a summary statistic with some known distribution under the null hypothesis (if using a parametric approach) with large (or extreme) values indicating rejection of the null hypothesis. Suppose that \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\) and \\(X_3\\) are the number of skittles out of 10 that person a, b and c, respectively, correctly identified. If each tasting is independent, then \\(X_1 \\sim B(10, p_1)\\), \\(X_2 \\sim B(10, p_2)\\) and \\(X_3 \\sim B(10, p_3)\\) where \\(p_i\\) is the probability that the \\(i\\)-th person correctly identifies the flavour of a skittle. Now under \\(H_0\\) you may assume that \\(p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = 0.2\\) and assuming each person is independent, \\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 \\sim B(30, 0.2)\\). Same as (d)! However, if we know remove the assumption that each tasting is independent (so the order of tasting does matter), then the distribution of the test statistic does not hold true any longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the plot below that shows in each tile whether a person guessed correctly by order of their tasting. Suppose that under the null hypothesis, the order of tasting does not matter and people have no ability to distinguish the flavours. Generate a null plot under this null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe null plot is constructed as follows.\n\ngtile &lt;- skittle %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(factor(order), person, fill = factor(correct))) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"black\", size = 2) +\n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(x = \"Order\", y = \"Person\", fill = \"Correct\")\ngtile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset.seed(1)\nmethod &lt;- null_dist(\"correct\", \"binom\", list(size = 1, prob = 0.2))\ngtile %+% method(skittle)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on (f), construct a lineup (using nullabor or otherwise) of 20 plots.

If we let \\(X\\) be the number of people who correctly identified the data plot in the lineup, then \\(X \\sim B(100, p)\\). The visual inference \\(p\\)-value is calculated from testing the hypotheses \\(H_0: p = 0.05\\) vs \\(H_1: p \\neq 0.05\\), and so is \\(P(X\\geq 76) \\approx 0\\).

This information was in all the news headlines at the time, and the analysis that these authors have done was checked against the common reporting at the time.

    "section": "Setting the frame of mind",
    "text": "Setting the frame of mind\nExcerpt from the introduction\n\nThis book is based on an important principle.\n It is important to understand what you CAN DO before you learn to measure how WELL you seem to have DONE it.\n Learning first what you can do will help you to work more easily and effectively.\n This book is about exploratory data analysis, about looking at data to see what it seems to say. It concentrates on simple arithmetic and easy-to-draw pictures. It regards whatever appearances we have recognized as partial descriptions, and tries to look beneath them for new insights. Its concern is with appearance, not with confirmation.\n Examples, NOT case histories\n The book does not exist to make the case that exploratory data analysis is useful. Rather it exists to expose its readers and users to a considerable variety of techniques for looking more effectively at one’s data. The examples are not intended to be complete case histories. Rather they should isolated techniques in action on real data. The emphasis is on general techniques, rather than specific problems. \nA basic problem about any body of data is to make it more easily and effectively handleable by minds – our minds, her mind, his mind. To this general end:\n\nanything that make a simpler description possible makes the description more easily handleable.\nanything that looks below the previously described surface makes the description more effective.\n\n\nSo we shall always be glad (a) to simplify description and (b) to describe one layer deeper. In particular,\n\nto be able to say that we looked one layer deeper, and found nothing, is a definite step forward – though not as far as to be able to say that we looked deeper and found thus-and-such.\nto be able to say that “if we change our point of view in the following way … things are simpler” is always a gain–though not quite so much as to be able to say “if we don’t bother to change out point of view (some other) things are equally simple.”\n\n …\n Consistent with this view, we believe, is a clear demand that pictures based on exploration of data should force their messages upon us. Pictures that emphasize what we already know–“security blankets” to reassure us–are frequently not worth the space they take. Pictures that have to be gone over with a reading glass to see the main point are wasteful of time and inadequate of effect. The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.\n\n\nConfirmation\n\n\nThe principles and procedures of what we call confirmatory data analysis are both widely used and one of the great intellectual products of our century. In their simplest form, these principles and procedures look at a sample–and at what that sample has told us about the population from which it came–and assess the precision with which our inference from sample to population is made. We can no longer get along without confirmatory data analysis. But we need not start with it.\n\nThe best way to understand what CAN be done is not longer–if it ever was–to ask what things could, in the current state of our skill techniques, be confirmed (positively or negatively). Even more understanding is lost if we consider each thing we can do to data only in terms of some set of very restrictive assumptions under which that thing is best possible–assumptions we know we CANNOT check in practice.\n\nExploration AND confirmation\n\nOnce upon a time, statisticians only explored. Then they learned to confirm exactly–to confirm a few things exactly, each under very specific circumstances. As they emphasized exact confirmation, their techniques inevitably became less flexible. The connection of the most used techniques with past insights was weakened. Anything to which confirmatory procedure was not explicitly attached was decried as “mere descriptive statistics”, no matter how much we learned from it.\n\nToday, the flexibility of (approximate) confirmation by the jacknife makes it relatively easy to ask, for almost any clearly specified exploration, “How far is it confirmed?”\n\nToday, exploratory and confirmatory can–and should–proceed side by side. This book, of course, considers only exploratory techniques, leaving confirmatory techniques to other accounts.\n\n\n About the problems \n\n The teacher needs to be careful about assigning problems. Not too many, please. They are likely to take longer than you think. The number supplied is to accommodate diversity of interest, not to keep everybody busy.\n Besides the length of our problems, both teacher and student need to realise that many problems do not have a single “right answer”. There can be many ways to approach a body of data. Not all are equally good. For some bodies of data this may be clear, but for others we may not be able to tell from a single body of data which approach is preferred. Even several bodies of data about very similar situations may not be enough to show which approach should be preferred. Accordingly, it will often be quite reasonable for different analysts to reach somewhat different analyses.\n Yet more–to unlock the analysis of a body of day, to find the good way to approach it, may require a key, whose finding is a creative act. Not everyone can be expected to create the key to any one situation. And to continue to paraphrase Barnum, no one can be expected to create a key to each situation he or she meets.\n To learn about data analysis, it is right that each of us try many things that do not work–that we tackle more problems than we make expert analyses of. We often learn less from an expertly done analysis than from one where, by not trying something, we missed–at least until we were told about it–an opportunity to learn more. Each teacher needs to recognize this in grading and commenting on problems.\n\n\n Precision\n\nThe teacher who heeds these words and admits that there need be no one correct approach may, I regret to contemplate, still want whatever is done to be digit perfect. (Under such a requirement, the write should still be able to pass the course, but it is not clear whether she would get an “A”.) One does, from time to time, have to produce digit-perfect, carefully checked results, but forgiving techniques that are not too distributed by unusual data are also, usually, little disturbed by SMALL arithmetic errors. The techniques we discuss here have been chosen to be forgiving. It is hoped, then, that small arithmetic errors will take little off the problem’s grades, leaving severe penalties for larger errors, either of arithmetic or concept."

Non-discovery is the failure to identify meaningful structure, and it may result in false or incomplete modeling. In a healthy scientific enterprise, the fear of non-discovery should be at least as great as the fear of false discovery."

    "text": "🔧 Preparation\nThe reading for this week is The Landscape of R Packages for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis. This is a lovely summary of software available that is considered to do exploratory data analysis (EDA). (Note: Dr Cook considers these to be mostly descriptive statistics packages, not exploratory data analysis in the true spirit of the term.) This reading will be the basis of the tutorial exercises today.\n\nComplete the weekly quiz, before the deadline!\nInstall this list of R packages, in addition to what you installed in the previous weeks:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"arsenal\", \"autoEDA\", \"DataExplorer\", \"dataMaid\", \"dlookr\", \"ExPanDaR\", \"explore\", \"exploreR\", \"funModeling\", \"inspectdf\", \"RtutoR\", \"SmartEDA\", \"summarytools\", \"visdat\", \"xray\", \"cranlogs\", \"tidyverse\", \"nycflights13\"))\n\n\nOpen your RStudio Project for this unit, (the one you created in week 1, ETC5521). Create a .qmd document for this weeks activities."

There is a regular up/down pattern, that if you zoom in closely - try plotting just a couple of weeks of data - you can see corresponds to week day vs weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nHow many functions does Staniak and Biecek (2019) say visdat has for doing EDA? Explore what each of them does, by running the example code for each function. What do you think are the features that make visdat a really popular package?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6; Simple focus, useful functions that apply to a lot of problems.\nIt gives an overview of the variable types, and missing values. This is useful to start a data analysis so that you can start working out what methods might be applied to each, and also whether some variables may have too many missing values to be analysable.\n\nlibrary(visdat)\n# function 1\nvis_dat(airquality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# function 2\nmessy_vector &lt;- c(TRUE,\n                 \"TRUE\",\n                 \"T\",\n                 \"01/01/01\",\n                 \"01/01/2001\",\n                 NA,\n                 NaN,\n                 \"NA\",\n                 \"Na\",\n                 \"na\",\n                 \"10\",\n                 10,\n                 \"10.1\",\n                 10.1,\n                 \"abc\",\n                 \"$%TG\")\nset.seed(1114)\nmessy_df &lt;- data.frame(var1 = messy_vector,\n                       var2 = sample(messy_vector),\n                       var3 = sample(messy_vector))\nvis_guess(messy_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# function 3\nvis_miss(airquality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# function 4\naq_diff &lt;- airquality\naq_diff[1:10, 1:2] &lt;- NA\nvis_compare(airquality, aq_diff)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# function 5\ndat_test &lt;- tibble::tribble(\n            ~x, ~y,\n            -1,  \"A\",\n            0,  \"B\",\n            1,  \"C\",\n            NA, NA\n            )\n\nvis_expect(dat_test, ~.x == -1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# function 6\nvis_cor(airquality)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nThe package summarytools appears to becoming more favourable relative to visdat.

And can be used to produce a detailed report on the data, although a report like the one in the next question took ages to complete.\nI’m not sure why it’s popularity has dropped. The documentation is not great, there’s quite a few spelling errors. The functions are (sort of) in CamelCase which is not as attractive as snake_case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.\nThe SmartEDA::ExpReport() and DataExplorer::create_report() are functions that generates a long report when provided with a data set. Try this using the latter function, on the nycflights13 data, using this code:\n\n# DataExplorer\nlibrary(DataExplorer)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Create a big data set\nairlines_all &lt;- flights |&gt; \n  full_join(airlines, by = \"carrier\") |&gt;\n  full_join(planes, by = \"tailnum\", \n            suffix = c(\"_flights\", \"_planes\")) |&gt;\n  full_join(airports, by = c(\"origin\"=\"faa\"), \n            suffix = c(\"_carrier\", \"_origin\")) |&gt;\n  full_join(airports, by = c(\"dest\"=\"faa\"), \n            suffix = c(\"_origin\", \"_dest\"))\n\n\ncreate_report(airlines_all, y = \"arr_delay\")\n\nThe code instructs to use arr_delay as a “response variable”. Give some reasons why this report is not very useful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of information, and many of the plots and tables are particularly unreadable.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave your Generative AI assistant suggest what to look at when it is given the variable summary, from:\n\n\nglimpse(airlines_all)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what I got from Claude:\nBased on the dataset you've provided, which appears to be about airline flights, I can suggest several plots and summaries that would be informative. Here are some recommendations:\n\nTime-based analysis:\n\nLine plot of average delays (dep_delay and arr_delay) by month and year\nHeatmap of delays by day of week and hour of day\nBox plots of air_time by month\n\n\nCarrier analysis:\n\nBar plot of flight counts by carrier\nBox plots of delays by carrier\nScatter plot of departure delay vs. arrival delay, colored by carrier\n\n\nRoute analysis:\n\nBar plot of most common routes (origin-dest pairs)\nMap visualization of routes with line thickness indicating frequency\n\n\nDistance analysis:\n\nScatter plot of distance vs. air_time\nHistogram of flight distances\n\n\nAircraft analysis:\n\nBar plot of most common aircraft models\nBox plot of delays by aircraft manufacturer\n\n\nAirport analysis:\n\nBar plot of busiest airports (by departure and arrival)\nMap of airports with point size indicating traffic volume\n\n\nSummaries:\n\nTable of average delays by carrier\nSummary statistics (mean, median, std dev) for air_time and distance\nCorrelation matrix of numeric variables\n\n\nTime series:\n\nTime series decomposition of daily flight counts\n\n\nCategorical data:\n\nStacked bar charts for engine types by manufacturer\n\n\nPerformance metrics:\n\nScatter plot of scheduled arrival time vs. actual arrival time\nIt’s nicely organise by different types of analysis activities that might be done. Each of these require different ways to aggregate the data, to make summaries or plots by various categorical variables. But it doesn’t suggest pre-processing that might be necessary, so I asked it to tell me what might be needed:\nBefore creating visualizations and summaries, some pre-processing steps would be beneficial for this dataset. Here are some recommendations:\n\nHandle missing values:\n\nCheck for NA or null values, especially in columns like speed, air_time, and delay fields.\nDecide whether to impute missing values or remove rows with missing data, depending on the extent and nature of missingness.\n\n\nDate and time formatting:\n\nCombine year_flights, month, and day into a single date column.\nEnsure time_hour is properly formatted as a datetime object.\n\n\nCategorical data:\n\nConvert appropriate columns to factors (e.g., carrier, origin, dest, manufacturer).\nCheck for and handle any inconsistent spellings or codings in categorical variables.\n\n\nDelay calculations:\n\nCreate a total_delay column by summing dep_delay and arr_delay.\nConsider creating a binary column for whether a flight was delayed (e.g., over 15 minutes).\n\n\nOutlier detection:\n\nCheck for and possibly handle extreme values in delay times, air_time, and distance.\n\n\nFeature engineering:\n\nCreate a day_of_week column from the date.\nCalculate flight speed from distance and air_time.\nCreate a season column based on month.\n\n\nData type conversions:\n\nEnsure numeric columns are of the appropriate type (int or float).\nConvert time columns (dep_time, arr_time, etc.) to a more usable format if they're not already.\n\n\nGeocoding:\n\nEnsure lat and lon columns for both origin and destination are numeric and contain valid coordinates.\n\n\nConsistency checks:\n\nVerify that arr_time is always later than dep_time.\nCheck that air_time is consistent with the difference between arr_time and dep_time.\n\n\nMerging data:\n\nIf the planes and airports data are in separate datasets, merge them carefully with the main flights data.\n\n\nCreating subsets:\n\nConsider creating smaller datasets for specific analyses (e.g., by year, by carrier) to improve processing speed.\nThis is quite useful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.\nIn a limited fashion, lets work through some areas suggested by Claude.\n\nUse visdat to examine the variable types and missing values. You’ll need to take a sample of the data because there are too many observations to reasonably plot. However, a sample should give reasonable insight on the reliability of most variables. What variables may not be useful because they have too many missing values?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvis_dat(airlines_all[sample(1:nrow(airlines_all), 1000),])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspeed is mostly missing. It definitely cannot be used.\ntype, manufacturer, model, engine, year_planes, engines, seats have a lot of missings, and so maybe unusable. It is possible that these missings are for some types of planes, and other types of planes have more complete records.\n\n\n\n\nFor the rest of these questions, you decide how to process the data, make summaries or plots to provide answers.\n\nWhich carrier had the most flights?\nIs this the same for each month? Or day of the week?\nAre there more departure delays for flights in the morning hours, or evening hours?\nFind an error in the data, e.g. a flight that arrived before it left.\nWith your neighbour in the tutorial come up with one thing that is a bit surprising to you that you can learn from this data. Make sure you state what you expected to see, and why what you saw was then a surprise. (It is possible that you can use the DataExplorer report to look at something you had not thought to examine, as motivation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nairlines_all |&gt; count(carrier, sort=TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 17 × 2\n   carrier     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n 1 UA      58665\n 2 B6      54635\n 3 EV      54173\n 4 DL      48110\n 5 AA      32729\n 6 MQ      26397\n 7 US      20536\n 8 9E      18460\n 9 WN      12275\n10 VX       5162\n11 FL       3260\n12 &lt;NA&gt;     2812\n13 AS        714\n14 F9        685\n15 YV        601\n16 HA        342\n17 OO         32\n\nairlines_all |&gt; \n  filter(carrier %in% c(\"UA\", \"B6\", \"EV\", \"DL\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(carrier = factor(carrier, levels = c(\"UA\", \"B6\", \"EV\", \"DL\"))) |&gt;\n  count(month, carrier) |&gt;\n  mutate(month = factor(month, levels=1:12)) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = carrier, \n              values_from = n, \n              values_fill=0)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 5\n   month    UA    B6    EV    DL\n   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 1      4637  4427  4171  3690\n 2 2      4346  4103  3827  3444\n 3 3      4971  4772  4726  4189\n 4 4      5047  4517  4561  4092\n 5 5      4960  4576  4817  4082\n 6 6      4975  4622  4456  4126\n 7 7      5066  4984  4641  4251\n 8 8      5124  4952  4563  4318\n 9 9      4694  4291  4725  3883\n10 10     5060  4361  4908  4093\n11 11     4854  4289  4471  3849\n12 12     4931  4741  4307  4093\n\nairlines_all |&gt; \n  filter(carrier %in% c(\"UA\", \"B6\", \"EV\", \"DL\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(carrier = factor(carrier, levels = c(\"UA\", \"B6\", \"EV\", \"DL\"))) |&gt;\n  count(month, carrier) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=month, y=n, colour=carrier)) + \n    geom_line() +\n    scale_x_continuous(\"\", breaks = 1:12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nairlines_all |&gt;\n  group_by(hour) |&gt;\n  summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=hour, y=dep_delay)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(se=F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nairlines_all |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, colour=\"red\") +\n    geom_point(aes(x=dep_delay, y=arr_delay)) +\n    theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nairlines_all |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=1, colour=\"red\") +\n    geom_point(aes(x=dep_time, y=arr_time)) +\n    theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nairlines_all |&gt; \n  filter(origin == dest)\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 42\n# ℹ 42 variables: year_flights &lt;int&gt;, month &lt;int&gt;, day &lt;int&gt;, dep_time &lt;int&gt;,\n#   sched_dep_time &lt;int&gt;, dep_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, arr_time &lt;int&gt;,\n#   sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt;, arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;,\n#   tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt;, name_carrier &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   year_planes &lt;int&gt;, type &lt;chr&gt;, manufacturer &lt;chr&gt;, model &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   engines &lt;int&gt;, seats &lt;int&gt;, speed &lt;int&gt;, engine &lt;chr&gt;, name_origin &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\n\nUA, United Airlines\nOoh, September EV had more flights than UA!\nDefinitely evening hours.\nThere are some flights that leave substantially early, maybe not a mistake but worrying for a traveller.\nWhat did you find?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.\nTable 2 of the Landscape paper summarises the activities of two early phases of the CRISP-DM standard.

Document it! Do it well!\n\n\n\n\nThe Census Bureau tabulates same-sex couples in both the American Community Survey (ACS) and the Decennial Census. Two questions are used to identify same-sex couples: relationship and sex. The agency follows edit rules that are used to change data values for seemingly contradictory answers. The edit rules for combining information from relationship and sex have evolved since the category of unmarried partner was added in 1990. In that census, if a household consisted of a married couple and both spouses reported the same sex, the relationship category remained husband or wife, but the sex of the partner who reported being a spouse to the householder was changed. Humans all the way down\n\n\n\n\nHuman actions are ubiquitous in every part of data analysis! The most objective methods often have had subjective actions before and after."

What types are variables are present in the data?\n\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n\nHow was this data collected? You will need to read the documentation for the palmerpenguins package.\nUsing the visdat package make an overview plot to examine types of variables and for missing values.\nCheck the distributions of each species on each of the size variables, using a jittered dotplot, using the geom_quasirandom() function in the ggbeeswarm package.

Check your thinking by making a suitable plot.\nIs there any indication of outliers from the jittered dotplots of different variables?\nMake a scatterplot of body_mass_g vs flipper_length_mm for all the penguins. What do the vertical stripes indicate?

Report the equation, the \\(R^2\\), \\(\\sigma\\), and make a residual plot of residuals vs flipper_length_mm. From the residual plot, are there any concerns about the model fit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nglimpse(penguins)\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 8\n$ species           &lt;fct&gt; Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    &lt;dbl&gt; 39, 40, 40, NA, 37, 39, 39, 39, 34, 42, 38, 38, 41, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     &lt;dbl&gt; 19, 17, 18, NA, 19, 21, 18, 20, 18, 20, 17, 17, 18, …\n$ flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt; 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       &lt;int&gt; 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               &lt;fct&gt; male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n\n\n\nDetails are at https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html, and you learn “These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were imported directly from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal.” It is necessary to also read the original data collection article https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081 to obtain details of the sampling. Breeding pairs of penguins were included based on sampling of nests where pairs of adults were present, were chosen and marked, before onset of egg-laying.\nThere are three factor variables - species, island, sex - and three integer variables - flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g and year - and two numeric variables - bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm.\n\nIt is interesting that flipper_length_mm and body_mass_g are reported without decimal places, and thus are integers, whereas bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm are reported with one decimal place, and thus are doubles. Both are numeric variables, though.\nFour variables have missing values: sex, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g. There are more missings on sex. The other missings occur together, the penguins are missing on all five variables.\n\nlibrary(visdat)\nvis_dat(penguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticularly on bill_length_mm multimodality can be seen in the Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins. This corresponds to differences in the two species. Differences can be seen in the sexes for all of the variables and species, but it is only big enough in bill_length_mm to be noticeable as bimodality.\n\n\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, \n                     y=bill_length_mm)) +\n  geom_quasirandom() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, \n                     y=bill_length_mm, \n                     colour=sex)) +\n  geom_quasirandom() +\n  scale_color_brewer(\"\", palette=\"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutliers can be seen on bill_length_mm for Chinstrap and Gentoo. Interestingly, there is one female penguins with a really big bill, bigger than all the males even.\n\nAlso on flipper_length_mm there is one female penguins with a much smaller value than others.\n\nThe striping corresponds to rounded values of flipper length, that have been reported to the nearest mm. It appears that it is done across all measuring as it is present for both sexes, for all species, for each island and each year. Otherwise there is nothing much to report as unusual.\n\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm,\n             y=body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm,\n             y=body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~island, ncol=3, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm,\n             y=body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~sex, ncol=2, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm,\n             y=body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~species, ncol=3, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  na.omit() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=flipper_length_mm,\n             y=body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~year, ncol=3, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model fit statistics suggest it is a reasonably good model, with flipper length explaining about 76% of body mass. From the estimated standard deviation of the error, \\(\\sigma=393\\), we could say that the estimated body mass is likely accurate to within 800g. (Assuming normal distribution and 95% of observations within two \\(\\sigma\\).)\n\nThe residual suggests no major problems. There is a little heteroskedasticity. Perhaps if you look carefully, though, it might indicate that different models should have been fitted for the smaller penguins and the bigger penguins, perhaps models separately for sex and species would be advised.\n\nlibrary(broom)\npenguins_nona &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\npenguins_fit &lt;- lm(body_mass_g~flipper_length_mm, data=penguins_nona)\ntidy(penguins_fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)        -5872.     310.       -18.9 1.18e- 54\n2 flipper_length_mm     50.2      1.54      32.6 3.13e-105\n\nglance(penguins_fit)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic   p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0.762         0.761  393.     1060. 3.13e-105     1 -2461. 4928. 4940.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\npenguins_m &lt;- augment(penguins_fit)\nggplot(penguins_m, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=.resid)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=1, colour=\"grey70\") +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Can we believe what we see?\nThis question uses material from this week’s lecture, from a few hours ago.\n\nIn the previous question we made subjective statements about the residual plot to determine if the model was a good fit or not. We’ll use randomisation to check any observations we made from the residual plot. The code below makes a lineup of the true plot against plots made with rotation residuals (nulls/good). When you run the code you will get a line decrypt(\"....\"), which you can copy and paste back in to the console window to get the location of the true plot (in case you forgot which it is). Does the true plot look like the null plots? If not, describe how it differs.\n\n\nlibrary(nullabor)\nggplot(lineup(null_lm(body_mass_g~flipper_length_mm, method=\"rotate\"),\n              penguins_m),\n       aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=.resid)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~.sample, ncol=5) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), \n        panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA, colour=\"black\"))\n\n\nPick one group, males or females, and one of Adelie, Chinstrap or Gentoo, and choose two of the four measurements. Fit a linear model, and do a lineup of the residuals. Can you tell which is the true plot? Show your lineup to your tutorial partner or someone else nearby and ask them\n\n\nto pick the plot that is most different.\nexplain why they picked that plot.\n\nUsing your decrypt() code locate the true plot. Is the true plot different from the nulls?\nDid you or your friend choose the data plot? Was it identifiable from the lineup or indistinguishable from the null plots?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe true plot looks a little different from the nulls. It has more of a V shape, which might suggest that the model fits poorly, that the smaller penguins have a different relationship than the larger penguins. It is evidence to support fitting separate models to the sexes and species.\nSomething like the following\n\n\nlibrary(nullabor)\npenguins_f_adelie &lt;- penguins_nona %&gt;%\n  filter(species == \"Adelie\",\n         sex == \"female\")\npenguins_f_adelie_bl_bd_fit &lt;- \n  lm(bill_depth_mm ~ bill_length_mm,\n     data=penguins_f_adelie)\npenguins_f_adelie_bl_bd_m &lt;-\n  augment(penguins_f_adelie_bl_bd_fit)\nggplot(lineup(null_lm(bill_depth_mm ~ \n                        bill_length_mm,\n                      method=\"rotate\"),\n              penguins_f_adelie_bl_bd_m),\n       aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=.resid)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~.sample, ncol=5) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), \n        panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA, colour=\"black\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would not be able to distinguish which is the true plot in this lineup."

The original data is from Postman et al. (1986) and this data is from Roeder with 83rd observation removed from the original data as well as typo for the 78th observation.\n\nPostman, M., Huchra, J.

Journal of the American Statistical Association 85, 617–624.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the description in the R Help for the data, what would be an appropriate null distribution of this data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe description in the R help for the data says Multimodality in such surveys is evidence for voids and superclusters in the far universe.\nDeciding on an appropriate null hypothesis is always tricky. If we wanted to test the statement that the data is multimodal, we could compare against a unimodal distribution, either a normal or an exponential depending on what shape we might expect.\nHowever, the published work has already made a claim that the data is multimodal, so it would be interesting to determine if we can generate samples from a multimodal distribution that are indistinguishable from the data.\n\\(H_0:\\) The distribution is multimodal. \\(H_a:\\) The distribution is something other than multimodal.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many observations are there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 82 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the data is multimodal, which of the following displays do you think would be the best? Which would not be at all useful?\n\n\nhistogram\nboxplot\ndensity plot\nviolin plot\njittered dot plot\nletter value plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you said a density plot, jittered dot plot, or a histogram, you’re on the right track, because each can give a fine resolution for showing modes. (The violin plot is not any different from a density plot, when only looking at one variable.)\n\n\n\n\n\nMake these plots for the data. Experiment with different binwidths for the histogram and different bandwiths for the density plot. Were you right in your thinking about which would be the best?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng &lt;- ggplot(tibble(galaxies), aes(galaxies)) +\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()\n  )\ng1 &lt;- g + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, color = \"white\") \ng2 &lt;- g + geom_boxplot() \ng3 &lt;- g + geom_density() \ng4 &lt;- g + geom_violin(aes(x=galaxies, y=1), draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))\ng5 &lt;- g + geom_quasirandom(aes(x=1, y=galaxies)) + coord_flip() \ng6 &lt;- g + geom_lv(aes(x=1, y=galaxies)) + coord_flip() \n\ng1 + g2 + g3 + g4 + g5 + g6 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFit your best mixture model to the data, and simulate 19 nulls to make a lineup.

There are clear cases of mislabelling, e.g. a one-minute long film classified as “not short”.\nOn further detective work, the original source of the data says “Any theatrical film or made-for-video title with a running time of less than 45 minutes, i.e., 44 minutes or less, or any TV series or TV movie with a running time of less than 22 minutes, i.e. 21 minutes or less. (A”half-hour” television program should not be listed as a Short.)” Given this is an objective measure based on the length of the film, we can see that that any films that are 45 minutes or longer should be classified as long and less than that as short.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would you use the lineup protocol to determine if the periodic peaks could happen by chance? What would be the null hypothesis? Make your lineup. Does the data plot stand out? Compute the \\(p\\)-value, if 5 out of 12 people picked the data plot as the most different one in the lineup. Comment on the results. (Note: It might be most useful to assess this only for movies between 50-150 minutes long.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmovies |&gt; \n  filter(between(length, 50, 150)) %&gt;%\n  select(length) %&gt;%\n  lineup(null_dist(\"length\", \"norm\"), true=., n=9) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n      breaks = c(0, 7, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180),\n      limits = c(0, 180)\n    ) +\n  facet_wrap(~.sample, ncol=3, scales=\"free\") +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulate samples from a normal distribution using the sample mean and standard deviation as the parameters.\n\\(H_0\\): Periodic peaks are not present by chance.\nI would expect the \\(p\\)-value to be 0 as the data plot is very clearly different from the nulls. This suggests that the multimodality is not possible to observe in samples from a normal distribution, and that the pattern is present because the movie lengths are commonly cut to specific numbers of minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: What is the market for different brands of whisky?\nThe Scotch data set in bayesm package was collated from a survey on scotch drinkers, recording the brand they consumed. Take a quick look at the data, and rearrange it to look like:\n\n\n# A tibble: 21 × 2\n   brand                      count\n   &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Ballantine                    99\n 2 Black & White                 81\n 3 Chivas Regal                 806\n 4 Clan MacGregor               103\n 5 Cutty Sark                   339\n 6 Dewar's White Label          517\n 7 Glenfiddich                  334\n 8 Glenlivet                    354\n 9 Grant's                       74\n10 J&B                          458\n11 Johnnie Walker Black Label   502\n12 Johnnie Walker Red Label     424\n13 Knockando                     47\n14 Macallan                      95\n15 Other Brands                 414\n16 Passport                      82\n17 Pinch (Haig)                 117\n18 Scoresby Rare                 79\n19 Ushers                        67\n20 White Horse                   62\n21 Singleton                     31\n\n\n\nProduce a barplot of the number of respondents per brand. What ordering of the brands do you think is the best? What is interesting about the distribution of counts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscotch_consumption |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    brand = fct_reorder(brand, count),\n    #brand = fct_relevel(brand, \"Other brands\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=count, y=brand)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 20 named brands and one category that is labelled as Other.brands. Produce a barplot that you think best reduces the number of categories by selecting a criteria to lump certain brands to the Other category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscotch_consumption |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    brand = ifelse(count &gt; 200, brand, \"Other brands\"),\n    brand = fct_reorder(brand, count),\n    brand = fct_relevel(brand, \"Other brands\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(count, brand)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve chosen the cut-off to be 200 as there was a gap in frequency between brands that sold more than 200 and less than 200. This reduces the comparison to 8 named brands, which is more manageable for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about what a not interesting pattern might be for this data, and formulate an appropriate null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe least interesting pattern is probably if all the bars are similar heights, meaning that all brands are consumed equally.\nThis leads to a null hypothesis of \\(H_o: p_k = 1/K\\) where all brands have the same proportion of consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to test whether this sample were consistent with a sample from a multinomial distribution, where all whiskeys were equally popular, how would to generate null samples? Make the lineup for testing this.\n\nThe following code might help:\n\n# Subset the data, and anonymmise brand name\nscotch_consumption_sub &lt;- scotch_consumption |&gt;\n    mutate(\n    brand = ifelse(count &gt; 200, brand, \"Other Brands\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(brand != \"Other Brands\") |&gt;\n  mutate(brand = as.character(factor(brand, labels=c(1:8)))) \n\nset.seed(220)\nsim &lt;- rmultinom(n=9,\n   size=sum(scotch_consumption_sub$count),\n   prob=rep(1/8, 8))\nsim &lt;- t(sim)\ncolnames(sim) &lt;- as.character(c(1:8))\nsim &lt;- sim |&gt;\n  as_tibble() |&gt;\n  mutate(.sample=1:9)\nsim &lt;- sim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols=`1`:`8`, names_to = \"brand\", values_to = \"count\")\nscotch_lineup &lt;- bind_rows(sim,\n  bind_cols(.sample=10, scotch_consumption_sub))\n\n# Randomise .sample  to hide data plot\nscotch_lineup$.sample &lt;- rep(sample(1:10, 10), rep(8, 10))\n  \n# Make the lineup\nggplot(scotch_lineup, aes(x=brand, y=count)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  facet_wrap(~.sample, scales=\"free\", ncol=5) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to simulate samples from a multinomial distribution for the null sets.\nIf the data was a sample from a uniform distribution, it would mean that all of these brands are typically consumed in equal quantity.\n\\(H_0:\\) The counts for the brands are consistent with a sample from a uniform distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally the bars are sorted from highest to lowest in each plot. This is tricky to do with facetting. The code below will do the sorting and re-draw the lineup.\n\n# Order categories in all samples from highest to lowest: TRICKY\np &lt;- list(\"p1\", \"p2\", \"p3\", \"p4\", \"p5\", \"p6\", \"p7\", \"p8\", \"p9\", \"p10\")\nfor (i in unique(scotch_lineup$.sample)) {\n  d &lt;- scotch_lineup |&gt; \n    filter(.sample == i)\n  d &lt;- d |&gt;\n    mutate(brand = fct_reorder(brand, count))\n  p[[i]] &lt;- ggplot(d, aes(y=brand, x=count)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    ggtitle(i) +\n    theme(axis.text = element_blank(),\n        axis.title = element_blank())\n}\n\np[[1]] + p[[2]] + p[[3]] + p[[4]] + p[[5]] +\n  p[[6]] + p[[7]] + p[[8]] + p[[9]] + p[[10]] + \n  plot_layout(ncol=5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you show your lineup to five of people who have not seen the data, and three of them report the data plot as the most different plot. Compute the \\(p\\)-value. What would these results tell you about the typical consumption of the different whiskey brands?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npvisual(5, 3, 10)\n\n     x simulated binom\n[1,] 5         0     0\n\n\nLikely people will report that the reason for choosing the plot is that one bar is much bigger than the other bars.\nIt tells us that the data is not a sample from multinomial with equal probabilities, at least in the sense that one brand is consumed more frequently than the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis ignored structure in the data, that survey participants could report consuming more than one brand. Have a discussion about what complications this might introduce for the analysis that we have just done. What might be an alternative way to compute the “counts” that takes this multiple responses into account? What else might we want to learn about survey participant responses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy ignoring the number of responses per participant we have made the assumption that all responses are independent of each other.\nOne alternative way to compute the counts would be convert each participants’ responses into a fraction of their responses, for example, participant 1,\n\nScotch[1,]\n\n  Chivas.Regal Dewar.s.White.Label Johnnie.Walker.Black.Label J...B\n1            1                   0                          0     0\n  Johnnie.Walker.Red.Label Other.Brands Glenlivet Cutty.Sark Glenfiddich\n1                        1            1         1          0           1\n  Pinch..Haig. Clan.MacGregor Ballantine Macallan Passport Black...White\n1            0              0          0        0        0             0\n  Scoresby.Rare Grants Ushers White.Horse Knockando the.Singleton\n1             0      0      0           0         0             0\n\n\nreports consuming Chivas.Regal, Johnnie.Walker.Red.Label, Other.Brands, Glenlivet, and Glenfiddich. Each 1 would then be converted to 1/5.\nThe reason for re-analysing this way is to equally weight participants’ responses, so a participant who responded a lot would contribute the same relative amount to the overall count as a participant who responded very little.\nOther questions that might be of interest are:\n\nDo some respondents drink a variety of brands and others only few?\nDo some brands get consumed together more often than others?\n\nYou might come up with some other ideas!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: What is the best transformation to make?\nFor each of the variables in the data, which-transform.csv, decide on an appropriate transformation to make the distribution more symmetric for five of the variables and remove discreteness on one variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tutor has suggestions."
