## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The goal of this worksheet is to tackle a data analysis together, by

- mapping out an analysis, with class input and help of AI
- work on cleaning a data set
- making some plots
- discussing what is surprising, and what is expected

## ðŸ“‹ About the data 

The data to use is available from [Tidy Tuesday 28 May 2024 page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-05-28/readme.md). Download the data from here, ideally using the `tidytuesdayR` package. You should only download the data from the Tidy Tuesday once, and save a copy locally on your computer. 

In addition the `gardenR` package, available from `remotes::install_github("llendway/gardenR")` has extra details about the garden.

This is the code to download the data, and load relevant libraries. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
# remotes::install_github("llendway/gardenR")
# install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
library(tidytuesdayR)
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-05-28')
save(tuesdata, file="tuesdata.rda")
```

```{r}
library(gardenR)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)

load("tuesdata.rda")
harvest_2020 <- tuesdata$harvest_2020
harvest_2021 <- tuesdata$harvest_2021
planting_2020 <- tuesdata$planting_2020
planting_2021 <- tuesdata$planting_2021
spending_2020 <- tuesdata$spending_2020
spending_2021 <- tuesdata$spending_2021

data("garden_coords")
```
